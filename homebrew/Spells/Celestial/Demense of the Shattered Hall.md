Weaving several mudras and striking forward, the world shatters and all those who witness it are drawn in.

Combatants who can see the void before the sorcerer  are Persuade with Int Occult targeting intimacies towards desires to fight, or any against the plights of the innocents around themselves. If the roll beats resolve, they and the battlegroups they command are drawn into the shattered halls. A broken and dangerous world of the sorcerer's making. [Effects go here about being inside]

probably lasts until the sorcerer is crashed or incapacitated.
And probably exactly 3 days? otherwise.

Control Bonus: Spend init to speed shape sorcery. Delecate surfaces tend to crack when you are emotional.

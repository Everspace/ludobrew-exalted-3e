## Shorthand

In this document I will be using the following shorthand when talking about costs:

| Term | meaning |
|:-----|:--------|
| # | number
| #m | # motes
| #i | # initiative
| #d | # dice
| as# | # autosuccess
| #a | # anima levels
| e | essence
| xp | experience
| sxp | silver xp
| X | unknown number
| x | unique resource
| tn# | target number #
| db# | double #s
| re# | reroll #
| #ncd | non-charm dice
| #ncas | non-charm autosuccess
| - | "lost" or removed
| + | "gained" or aquired
| * | multiply

* `tn+1` read as "target number increased by 1".
* `tn-1` reduce target number 1.
* `db+1` gain further doubles (db+1 is db9, db+1 again is db8)
* `re+1` add a die number to be rerolled.

## Quick Rules of Thumb

Generally the cost of things will be as such:

| X | Y |
|:-:|:-:
| 1m | 1d
| 2m | as1
| 1wp | 5m
| 1a | 5m
| 1xp | 10m
| tn-1 | ncas1.5
| db+1 | ncas1
| re+1 | ncas1

* If you have something that goes from X to Y, balance as if it was in the middle (3 for traits, major for intimacy)
* If it inflicts or changes a combat state, it should proably cost initiative
* If it has big narrative impact, it should probably cost willpower or anima
* If it the cost is above 4m, it can be more powerful.
* Scenelong +Xd should cost roughly 2*Xd. If you do the thing twice, it costs as much has having spent it on individual actions.
* Celestial exalts that are not Sidereals should probably never get access to tnX stuff.

## Initiative costs

Generally you have to pay both for the gain of initiative of yourself, and the loss of initiative that you cause on someone else.

| X | Y |
|:-:|:-:
| 1m | +1i or -1i
| 2m | 1i


## The Cost of things

The amount of power that can go into a charm and feel fair is roughly a combination of:

* Type of XP spent (normal or splat xp)
* What type of exalt you are
* Required Invested XP to have this charm
* Restrictions of use
* Drawbacks of use
* Required resources to use the charm

## Specific table of things that cost other things

| Thing | Cost
|:-----:|:----:
| -1 penalty removed | 1m/per
| -1 penalty applied | 3m/per

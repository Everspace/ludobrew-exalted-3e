# This charm sucks

I agree for lots of charms. I am happy to change prerequisites, or the intent of the charm to make it less smelly.

This includes typically:

- Reducing the prerequisites to at max 5-6 charms
- Turning repurchases to essence upgrades (e.g. Supreme Masterwork Focus)
- Bundling various charms together into a singular charm
- Removing/reducing mote costs if there is already Anima or Willpower Costs.
- Making charms less hard to actually use (Rampaging Berserker Attack).

This includes me moving certain charms to "Universal" for Solars, where they don't have ability dot prerequisites.

The tweaks, vanilla "ok" charms, and rulings for any charm live in the "normal name" for that splat, like [Solar](/solar/) or [Lunar](/lunar/)

# Splat Tweaks

## Solar

* Your supernal ability starts at 5 for free.
* Your favoured abilities start at 1 without needing to add dots.
* Martial Art Supernal can:
  * buy dots, and charms at 1/2 price
  * At character creation, you receive a free MA charm for every MA charm you purchase
  * Come up with solar charm improvements that stitch into martial arts charms.
* Performance charms do not automatically waive the -3 penalty for speaking to a group. For that please take [Artful Social Grace](/second-sunrise/universal/artful-social-grace) does not

## Lunar

* You may select an Apex attribute at character generation to replace one of your caste attributes. This enables your essence to be treated as 3 for the purposes of purchasing charms, until essence 3, where it is treated as essence 5. I have yet to decide how this works for Castless Lunars if they get their tattoes later.


# Stats for things

The following stats are able to be calculated in addition to the defaults.

| Stat | New options |
|:-----|:-----------:|
| Disengage   | Dexterity + Athletics
| Join Battle | Perception + Awareness
| Parry       | Stamina + [Weapon Skill or Resistance]
| Read Intent | [Perception or Wits] + [Socialize or Investigation] (and some other cases)
| Resolve     | [Charisma or Wits] + Integrity
| Rush        | Strength + Athletics

**Charm changes from the above that aren't worth putting in the triage section**

- Probably

# Social

* **Linguistics** can be used speak eloquently using your mastery of language and semantics.
* Your character knows how to use their stuff where you don't. Your character will be able to figure out how to use their **Charisma**, **Manipulation**, or **Appearance** for most situations.
* **Occult**, **Buracuracy**, and **Survival** may be used instead of a social stat in their area of expertise. This includes for Read-Intent.

## Guidelines

This is how I interpret the various socially aligned stats. This is not the be-all end all. Your character knows how to do their attributes and abilities for the most part. However this does not mean someone with a [Manipulation + Socialize] of 10 is never going to roll their [Charisma + Linguistics] of 3 as they try to write a letter to someone expressing their love.

**Attributes**

| Stat | Used for |
|:---- | :------: |
| **Social** | --- |
| Charisma | Making an ernest argument. The intimacy or reasoning is based around the character themselves posses |
| Manipulation | Invoking emotions. Getting a person to work in certain ways for your own, or someone else's personal benefit. |
| Appearance | Invoking emotions. Intimacies both positive and negatively related to you. Stunts that involve a physicality to them. |
| **Mental** | --- |
| Intelligence | Recall information or history about things. |
| Wits | Figure out why, where, and how in the "now", but no context |

**Standard Abilities**

| Stat | Used for |
|:-----|:--------:|
| Linguistics | Argument is written or is based in debate, or is spoken with the intent that the words themselves are inspiring or thoughtful. |
| Presence | Making someone believe or change their manner based on it being "you" and no-one else.
| Performance | Argument is delivered with passion, even if the words are garbled or not quite right. Delivering an argument duplicitously. Things that could be considered "art"
| Socialize | Making someone feel something due to their cultural values, manipulating intimacies that someone holds about other people.

**Un-Standard Abilites**

| Stat | Used for |
|:---- | :------: |
| Bureaucracy | Relating to foreign policy, governance, ruling, running an organization, or bargaining |
| Occult | Talking to ghosts ðŸ‘», Spirits âœ¨, and Demons ðŸ‘º |
| Survival | Instilling, inspiring, bargaining, intimidating animals. |

## Downtime

# Craft

* The craft stats are based around the 5 elements from 2nd edition by default. They are and roughly the categories they encompass:
  * **Earth**: Stonework, Architecture, Statuary
  * **Wind**: Jewlery, Paint, Arts
  * **Water**: Cooking, Alchemy, Leatherworking,
  * **Fire**: Blacksmithing
  * **Wood**: Carving, Weaving
  * **Geomancy**: Manse construction, Layline movement/Demesne construction.
  * **Artifact**: Artifact construction
  * **First Age Artifice** (FAA)

## Artifacts

* You must AT LEAST come up with an attunement effect, and at least 1 entry evocation for any artifact.
* Every artifact gains 1 "free" evocation at every essence level. This includes already released ones.
* Evocations are "as good" as ~1-2 dice off of equal essence solar charms if you are resonant.
* Attunements are like a (Dot rating -1) solar charm.
* The stunt for crafting an artifact carries throughout an extended craft. If you write me a little paragraph or two about how you make the thing (as a short story) you get an automatic 3 point stunt to carry through.
* If you play a DBT Lunar, you will have to make the approprate Resonant/Dissonant keyword additions.

# Time

Time adjusting effects follow the [/pages/time-table](Time Table).

## Training

* Training Times are as listed
* You may have any number of things being trained, as long as they are not pre-requisites for other things (Dots needed for charms, charms needed for other charms)
* A person with appropriate charms to justify teaching (if mental) or physically training someone will be able to greatly accellerate training times.
* Having a mentor that is applicable will also reduce training times.

## Downtime

* You have 3 parts to a day, morning, afternoon, and evening.
* These are used as rough estimates of how much you can "do" at once during your downtime. This is generally used to do something like discover plot points or acquire merits
* Sorcerous workings take up 1 part of your day for each circle they are. Terrestrial 1, Celestial 2, Solar 3.
* You may use a part of a day to gain Craft XP as if you completed a Basic Project if it fulfills a base objective.

# Player controlled NPCs

Must be approved by me before being used.

# Sorcery

## Workings

* Workings that give things QC stats are at the level of an appropriate "Demon of the Xth Circle", and will almost always be `Circle 3` workings

## Summoning

* There exists a "Summon Elemental" version of "Summon Demon" spells
* Elementals are never able to dematerialize unless their nature is ephemeral (in which case they're probably not very useful), in exchange they get weird and wonderful powers to move through things normally harder to pass through (and probably take you along if you wish).
* Task-based duration summons in the form of a "storybook-esque" binding based around the format of "Do a thing UNTIL an event happens" are almost always valid.
  * Guard the castle until it falls to foreign hands
  * Be part of my army until I am gravely wounded
* Task-based duration summons have a defining intimacy to the task you've given them in addition to yourself. You must perform Kung-Fu to stop them if the two conflict.
* Summoning demons/elementals is fraught with peril. You will have to:
  * Contest with their resolve, charms to boost their resolve, and their intimacies regarding "I would rather be free to do my own interests" which is at least major.
  * Tasks-based summons are much easier if they like the task you ask of them, or it's in their nature.
  * Deal with someone else maybe wanting to summon them, or them already being them bound to a mysterious task in an ancient ruin of a prior age...
* If you want the full Cadre of 12 Second Circle Demons, you need to write them. I will not help you beyond the first.

# Merits

## Ally

Controlled by me. Views you as an equal, and has the equivalent of a Major intimacy supporting you that they will try to defend to their best ability. The advance about half as fast as the player and pick charms that fit their personality, rather than being what is optimal.

| # | Notes |
|:------|-------|
| 1 | Essence 2 Dragonblooded, with a very interesting position or bundle of merits if not combat capable.
| 3 | An essence 1 celestial exalt.
| 5 | An essence 3 celestial exalt, or perhaps a Dragonblooded house matriarch overlooks that anathema problem due to your use or relationship to her and can be called in for a BIG favour.

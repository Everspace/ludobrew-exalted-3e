The Force's continence is so great, lesser beings remember __nothing__ about her.

This charm supplements a social influence roll. Regardless of success, the witnesses remember no detail of her except for a particular feature. Her hair, a booming voice, her hight of 11ft. Even in the presence of other distractions like her anima at full bonfire.

However, this charm consequently allows them to identify the solar easily, affording them her (app+presence/2) non charm successes to do so, and nothing will make the witness forget the solar altogether either.

The Scoundrel easily dissuades people from seeing the dirt behind their deeds.

When someone catches the solar in a situation that reveals their crimes, she may use this charm to recount a different reason for their current predicament, or pin the blame on someone else. This allows them to substitute a normal persuade with a Larceny based one if they choose, with (Larceny) dice regardless.

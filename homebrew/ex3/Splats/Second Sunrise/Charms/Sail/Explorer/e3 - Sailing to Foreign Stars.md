With some help, the explorer plots a path to a place they've never been.

With the assistance of a denizen of some other plane of existance, travel to that other plane over the course of 5 days. Be guided to Yu Shan by a Sidereal or a God, or a Blood Ape to their hovel in Malfeas.

If outside of creation, they can navigate back, remembering creation's stars instead.

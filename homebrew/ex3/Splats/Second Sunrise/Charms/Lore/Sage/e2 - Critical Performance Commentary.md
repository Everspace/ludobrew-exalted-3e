The sage studies at all times, giving her insight into hidden flaws and various failings in comparison to the perfection of the sun and it's chosen.

The sage may introduce fact about the flaws in a person's particular ability, initiating a contest between the Solar's [Perception or Wits] + Lore, and a pool derived on the ability being discussed. If the solar wins, they may penalize the opponent (Lore/2, round up) dice in that ability for the rest of the scene, which may in turn affect static values. If the solar is wrong in her findings, she is in turn penalized the same dice as she acts upon mistaken information.

For example, a solar may comment on a particular socialite's subtle change in tone as she lies, commenting on the person's Socialze, contesting her Perception + Lore vs his Manipulation + Socialize.

The sage is a source of infinite knowledge, and knows how to apply it to boot!

Apply all applicable and topical specialties to any roll.

For example when convincing the people of a Chiaroscuro Teahouse to wage a war, you for example could use a speciality in Craft(Tea), Socialize(Teahouses), and Bureaucracy(Chiaroscuro) to argue your case with Charisma + Presence.

The teacher is as much a student as they are instructor.

When you teach someone, gain a speciality related to what the student knows.

Teaching the people of a Chiaroscuro Teahouse the ways of war could give you for example a speciality in Craft(Tea), Socialize(Teahouses), or Bureaucracy(Chiaroscuro)

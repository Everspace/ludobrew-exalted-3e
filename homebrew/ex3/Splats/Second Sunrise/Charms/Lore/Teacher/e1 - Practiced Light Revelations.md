The teacher draws upon the wells of her experience, and gives it to others.

Once per story per person, you may give someone any amount of XP debt for an ability you have to raise it up to the number of dots you have it at. You may raise a single humanoid quick character ability pool up to what pool you would have for the same task.

If that skill is a martial art, you may impart the Martial Artist (••••) merit at the same time without cost.

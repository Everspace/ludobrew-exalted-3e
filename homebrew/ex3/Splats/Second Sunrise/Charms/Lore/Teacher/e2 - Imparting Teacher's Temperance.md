The teacher's guidance rubs off on the student, and their beliefs are shaped by the teacher's lessions.

Whenever a person goes into XP debt from one of your charms, for each 3xp they went, you may raise the intensity or impart an intimacy or principle that you have up to the intensity you have it at.

If a quick character improves, they gain that intimacy at a rate of 1 level per 2 dice added to a pool (rounding up), or in the case of [Ephemeral Mystery Instruction ](/ex3/second-sunrise/lore/ephemeral-mystery-instruction) 1 level per additional thing imparted.

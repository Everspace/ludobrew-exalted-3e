The merchant pulls wealth out of seemingly nowhere, cajoling 10,000 people for a single silver to make a mountain of coins.

Use dots representing groups of people such as Following, or Command as if they were resources to acquire something. If the solar is part of a circle, it counts as at least 1 dot, and if they let you, you may use their resources for this charm's effect.

This charm also allows you to pair 2 same value units of resources to effectively have a resources 1 higher.

For example, Edgar Lionbrush uses this charm to combine his Followers (•), his Resources (••), and his circle (•) to make a purchase of Resources (•••)

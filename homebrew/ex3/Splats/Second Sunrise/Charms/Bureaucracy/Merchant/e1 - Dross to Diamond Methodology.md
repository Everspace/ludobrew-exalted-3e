The solar is a canny businesswoman, hawking her wares to greater heights on words alone. When her goods don't speak for themselves, she speaks for them.

When you offer someone something, you may pass off it as more valueable than it is. Roll [Manipulation or Charisma] + Bureaucracy vs their Resolve + (target resource value - actual resource value).

On a success, the person and all in attendance consider the offer as presented. On failure, the presentation is just considered at it's normal value, with the heightened value as a joke, jest, or business as usual.

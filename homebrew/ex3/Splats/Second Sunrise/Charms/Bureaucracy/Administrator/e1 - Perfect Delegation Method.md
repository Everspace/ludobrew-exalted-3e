The Administrator instructs what is to happen, and her delegates make it so.

Make an (Intelligence + Bureaucracy) for a battlegroup (or group of people you manage) outside of combat to perform a task on your behalf. They gain (the successes) dice to perform that task, and maintain this benefit for as long as it takes to perform this task.

You may apply this charm for up to (Bureaucracy) tasks.

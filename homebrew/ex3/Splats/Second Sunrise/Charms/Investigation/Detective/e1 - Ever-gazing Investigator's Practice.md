The Detective keeps an impeccable dossier on everyone. Everyone is a suspect, and she has all the people.

Whenever you talk personally to another person, they are added to your **Suspect Library** automatically, then you may pay 3m to perform a Case Person on someone in it based on when you last talked to them.

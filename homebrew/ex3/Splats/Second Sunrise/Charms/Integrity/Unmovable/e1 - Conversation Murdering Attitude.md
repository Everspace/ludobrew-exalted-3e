The Unmovable removes herself instead of letting others move her.

At any time, including in a decision point, she may choose to dramatically remove herself from the scene rather than be subject to the results of a social influence action. For example, she may leap through a window or break down a door to storm out. Once she has left, she cannot return.

While making her exit, she is not subject to further influence, and may use Integrity as her Ability for any rolls required in her departure.

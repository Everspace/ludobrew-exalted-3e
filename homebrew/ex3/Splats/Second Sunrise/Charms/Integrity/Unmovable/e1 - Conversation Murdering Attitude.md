The Unmovable removes herself instead of letting others move her.

Instead of taking the results of a social influence, or during a decision point, you may instead dramatically exit the scene, unable to return. You may roll with Integrity instead of the normal attribute if it assists you in getting away in order to do things like leaping through windows or breaking down doors that bar your path.

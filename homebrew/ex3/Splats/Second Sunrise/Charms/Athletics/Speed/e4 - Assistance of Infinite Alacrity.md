The Speed's quickness is the grease in the wheels for almost any project she commits to.

Assist another character with a non-combat roll. Their roll is done (Essence) steps faster, and benefits from (your Athletics) in dice. The dice cap is the higher of (Wits + Athletics) or (Their pool). You may apply any Athletics excellency you know to the roll as well by either yourself, or the assisted paying for it.

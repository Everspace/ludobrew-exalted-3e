The canny socialite picks up on subtle cues and signs to glean information out of private conversations, and hidden intrigues.

Read intent on a participant of a conversation that you were not present for. This also allows the solar to attempt to eavesdrop on effects like *Subtle Speech*, by first allowing the socialite to determine something additional was spoken, and secondly allowing the use of this charm for the "private conversation".

When the Creator obtains a item from someone relating to a tie or based on one the person possesses at defining level, it may be used as a Exotic Material for the purposes of crafting an Artifact or constructing a Manse. It may also be used as a Means for Sorcerous Workings if desired. When you do so it is irrevocably destroyed or altered into a new form.

The material's power is based on the essence of the giver

| Essence | Working |
|:-------:|:-------:|
| 1 and 2 | Terrestrial |
| 3 and 4 | Celestial |
| 5+ | Solar |

Additionally, a spirit treats it's essence has half as much (rounded up). Members of the Solar's circle, and their Lunar mate are treated as having an essence 2 higher than they actually do.

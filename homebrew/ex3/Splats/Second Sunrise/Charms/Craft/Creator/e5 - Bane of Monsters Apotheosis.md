The solar beckons a new thing into existence from something precious, to defend creation.

Once a story, create an Artifact (••••) designed to slay a Creature of Darkness or Enemy of Creation, giving up something valuable in it's forging. This could be a merit, taking a crippling wound, an intimacy of major, or something that is representational of the monster. The craft is completed instantly, and without rolling, receiving (STUFF)wxp

**If it is a weapon**, it's touch is aggravating to the evil it is meant to slay, and it grants an additional defence, (relevant intimacy) dice to hit, and (relevant intimacy) damage fighting the creature. The crafter may always use it as if your melee pool was your craft pool.

**If it is an armour**, it is equipped instantly in the monster's presence, and negates hazards or penalties caused by the monster, and the monster cannot do aggravating damage to you or cause you crippling wounds.

**If it is a curio**, it counteracts the monster by negating or overpowering the charm or effect that has hurt you and those you care about the most.

In all cases, there is an evocation in the artifact that is unlocked for free, when a dramatic action or effect would be cool to add to something you do.

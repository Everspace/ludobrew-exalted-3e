Perform a repair project of any scale, and perfectly adapt something for something else that it is ill suited for.

A solar may make a home in sunken Luthe tailor-made for an Ifriti and their life around it; a series of swords perfected for swinging in the air while winged.

This prevents any physical complications from applying to mundane items or features improved with charm.

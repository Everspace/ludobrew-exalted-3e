Suppliment a read intent towards understanding a person's tie towards another. Unless contested by magic, you gain a perfect understanding of what they would do if that person was dead or some similar measure of "gone forever, or not a problem anymore". If contested by magic and you fail the read intent, you only get the emotion that would elicit (joy, sadness, anger)

This is not limited by their ability, but their imagination. If you enact this retribution, gain 2wp.

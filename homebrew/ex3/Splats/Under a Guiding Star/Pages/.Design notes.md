## Sidereals are

* **scheming** they prepare and are powerful when doing so
* **representational** do something like something else. Painting the fence is a kung fu move
* **lucky** they have fate on their side, and events naturally conspire in their favour.



## Charms

Are in groups of 3

1. **__Conventional__**: just regular everyday ability via luck or scheming or fating it up pretty good through their own aptitude.
2. Representational / extremely fate-y - Curing their boil to heal a relationship.
3. Astrologically informed - about the constellation more than the ability.


## NEW KEYWORDS

* **Fate-Altering**: causes change to the world. Things without the keyword happen "normally" going forward. Fate-Altering means history has been rewritten.

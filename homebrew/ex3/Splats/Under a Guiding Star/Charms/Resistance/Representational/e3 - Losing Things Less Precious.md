The Sideral blunts a blow with her relationships and treasures instead of sustaining injury to her person.

The Sidereal may sustain (Essence) crippling wounds every story. She may also *instead of losing something like a hand or eye*, activate this charm instead lose a merit. She gains 3 Sidereal xp for each dot lost this way + an additional (intimacy to that thing)xp for doing so and, you are immune to any similar or lesser event for the rest of the story.

For example, avoiding drowning in acid renders you immune to drowning, or acid pits in the future, but not things such as the Lunar's deadly acids produced by them or a charm they have.

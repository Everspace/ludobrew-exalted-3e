The Sidereal mends the snarls accumulated on a poor soul, and purifies the thread of their fate.

Roll (Intelligence + Medicine) to clash or contest a shaping effect, or remove the the result of one. The difficulty to do so is equal to (the source's Essence/2, round up). This may also remove a mutation, or any flaw from a willing person at a difficulty of (rating of mutation).

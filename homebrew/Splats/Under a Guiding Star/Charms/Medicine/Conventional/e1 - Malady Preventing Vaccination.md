The Sidereal is a master of planning the future. What's a little preventative medicine to masters of fate?

Vaccinate up to (Medicine) times on different people, or the same person. Next time they would need to roll Resistance or Stamina to stop harm, remove a Vaccination on that person and they may use your (Int + Medicine) pool instead, and (they or yourself) may apply your excellency instead of their own.

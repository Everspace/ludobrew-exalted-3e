splat: Under a Guiding Star
title: 01 - Intro
---

The stars shine from above, and their light touches everything. The strings as they perform their cosmic dance pull and twist into the fabric of creation. Everyone follows the guidance of the constellations above, and their life is under a guiding star.

Sidereals are the masters of theses strings. They cloak themselves in fate, and twist and pull at the movement of the stars to right what was wrong, and spin new cloth of a brighter future into motion. Their power is the manipulation of fate and the connections therein.

## The Drive to Be Connected

While other exalts feel the sways of Rage, of Glory, or the elements that command them, Sidereals feel connectedness.

The fever of their essence is to seek others and be a part of their lives. The heady and indoxicating feeling of being a part of something great, and the fufillment of things. Sidereals desire to find meaning while using their powers, to involve themselves with the lives of others. Fate is the connection and the gift of the maidens is to know and treasure all the connectedness of all things.

At it's worst, its meddling in the lives of people for selfish reasons. Breaking apart lovers, and ending kingships for the sheer thrill of the power one has over the lives of others.

At it's best, the love and care of true kinship of a person who means only the best for you, and the feeling of being treasured and understood in ways you may never know yourself.

## Severed from the Web

Long ago, the Sidereals saw the exalted host overly decadent, and it's state a rot threatening to pull all things to ruin. With their infinite art they severed the host, and sealed away the Solars who had seperated themselves from the world they lived in.

This took the compounded ties that the Dragonblooded host had cultivated over years of family, and the Sidereal's connection to the world to cast them out. The details of

- The Journey to seal them
- The Battle to weaken them,
- The Serenity they lived in
- The Secrets employed to remove them
- The Ending of their age

were lost to even the Sidereals as the old exalted host was cast physically, and spiritually out of Creation for what seemed to be forever, until now.

## Simple Minds Drawing Lines

Some who have glimpses into the agents of heaven's plans think of things in simple terms. "It is us vs them". They think the many layers of the splendid isle a unified host of heaven as if it ever was.

It is no different than lords of the 1000 Kingdoms warring each other for supplies, or finding accords to common goals and mutual benefit. It is almost natural the force that Sidereals wield connects them with each other, for now more than ever they are alone in the world that wishes to forget them. To come together and guide the world to ends that benefit all.

Many do, and thus the perception of a "Faction" arises, Visions of Bronze or Visions of Gold. But at the end of all days between supernal beings called Exalts, great feuds and rivalries arise. Disagreements and alliances are textured and nuanced between those who act upon them.

The only saving grace that stops escalation is heaven's laws, and the loneliness that comes from want of a person who will always remember you weather in anger, fear, or kinship.

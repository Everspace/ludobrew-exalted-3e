Excellencies are the base powers that the Dragonblooded exalted are able to call upon to perform great feats for whatever they endeavour to do.

Each Excellence is bought as an appropriate charm under the ability in question, and costs the same as buying any charm for that ability. For example, [Flow of Ability](./flow-of-ability) for Bureaucracy is **Flow of Bureaucracy**.

When reading a charm, **Excellence #** should be read as **Ability #** required. For example, **Flow of Bureaucracy** requires a Bureaucracy rating of 1 to learn.

A dragonblood may buy only 1 Excellency per ability, until Essence 3 and 5, in which they purchase a further excellency for a total of 2 excellencies at essence 3, and 3 excellencies at essence 5.

In addition, a Dragonblooded hearthmate may pay for an excellency of the same type that another Dragonblooded is using in the same scene. For example, someone is attacking an anathema using [Explosion of Melee](./explosion-of-ability) by paying 2m, their ally pays for [Flow of Melee](./flow-of-ability), and so the attack benefits from 2 autosuccesses, rerolling 6s and 10s. This never exceeds the recpiant's maximum benefit for dice caps (6 dice or 3 autoucesses) but does not prevent 5 different people from applying all 5 Excellencies for their secondary effects even if the autosuccesses are "wasted".

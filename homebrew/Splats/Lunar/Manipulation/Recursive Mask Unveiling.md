The lunar rips off a disguise, doffs a wig revealing yet another mask underneath.

They may make disguises instantly and use both Moonlight-on-Mist Puzzle and Many-Faced Moon Transformation
(waiving the wp cost of the charm) while doing so. Alternatively they may instead shapeshift into a humanoid form that
hides the act of doing so in acts like doffing-off a wig, or wiping off make-up. This functions as a disguise roll using
([one of Appearance Intelligence, or Manipulation] + Larceny) that is contested by the lower of the opponent's
Investigation or Awareness pool. If successful, the lunar's new "disguise" is believed to be their true appearance with
the prior being an act of sublime legerdemain, on a failure the witnesses knows this is not their true self and their identity
is still a mystery. In either case, the shapeshifting is completely unnoticed.

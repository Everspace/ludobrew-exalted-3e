Excellencies are the base powers that the Solar exalted are able to call upon to perform great feats for whatever they endeavour to do.

Each Excellence is bought as an appropriate charm under the ability in question, and costs the same as buying any charm for that ability. For example, [Flawless Solar Ability](./flawless-solar-ability) for Bureaucracy is **Flawless Solar Bureaucracy**.

When reading a charm, **Excellence #** should be read as **Ability #** required. For example, **Refulgent Solar Lore** requires a Lore rating of 3 to learn.

The Passionate dives into a state of fugue where there is nothing but her emotions.

Once per story the solar may submit themselves to an All-Consuming (••••• •••••) intimacy for a scene. This intimacy is based on a defining or higher intimacy that they have at the time. While in this state they are treated like having no other intimacies but the All-Consuming one. Otherwise, this heightened and dangerous feeling may only be persued with the appropriate power of other charms. Like a limit break, this state of heightened emotion may only be broken by the solar's actions endangering someone they have a major tie towards.

After the scene ends, the solar may shed up to 3 points of limit, and regain up to 3 willpower.

This charm may be reset if the solar experiences limit-break unaided by charms.

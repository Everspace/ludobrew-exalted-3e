The Passionate has found to tap into inner reserves beyond normal mortals. Her devotion allowing her to put vast amounts of will into any action.

The solar may spend any amount of willpower on a roll if it supports a major or higher intimacy. If she spends 3wp or more on a any roll (once all costs are factored), and is successful, she regains 1wp.

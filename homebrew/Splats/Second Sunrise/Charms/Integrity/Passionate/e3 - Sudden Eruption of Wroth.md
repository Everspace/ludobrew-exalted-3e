The Passionate's vast oceans of feelings come crashing upon all who dare oppose her.

When the solar goes to roll join battle, she may activate Perfectly Placed Hysterics to raise the intimacy that was most directly responsible (or most relevant) for her participation in the scene. Afterwards she adds (intimacy) non-charm dice to the roll and may roll join battle with (Wits + Integrity) instead of the normal roll.

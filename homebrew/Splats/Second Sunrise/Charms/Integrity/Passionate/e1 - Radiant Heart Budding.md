The Passionate is able to feel beyond mortal definitions of such matters of the heart. Their inner sun shining beyond compare.

This charm unlocks a new level of intimacy, Integral (••••• •). This allows intimacies to be raised to this new level of feeling, and one defining intimacy may be promoted to Integral upon purchase. Only 1 feeling can remain at integral at a time.

## What does this mean?

Intimacies above defining continue to work like other levels of intimacies, just at appropriate and greater levels. This means

* Rolling more dice for limit
* Gaining the appropriate benefits for an intimacy... but just bigger!

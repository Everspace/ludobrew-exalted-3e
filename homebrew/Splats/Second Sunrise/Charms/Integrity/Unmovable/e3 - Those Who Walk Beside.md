The Unmovable being's own solidness eclipses others, and through it, becomes their bastion and beadrock when the world turns in termoil.

Another person may apply the solar's modified Resolve or use her dice pool to resist an effect that _Phoenix Renewal Tactic_ would apply to. The Unmovable may also use charms she knows that are applicable on the recipient's behalf.

If she choses to apply _Phoenix Renewal Tactic_, the legend is based on her relation to the Solar, and how she feels about them.

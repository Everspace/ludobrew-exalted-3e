The Unmovable steels herself before discussions start. Her heart hardened, and her purpose becomes clear before the first word is spoken.

The Solar selects an intimacy of her choosing, and gains (Intimacy) resolve for the scene. However, her Guile in regards to that intimacy is reduced by (Intimacy).

The alternative committed cost of 7m changes the duration to Permanent.

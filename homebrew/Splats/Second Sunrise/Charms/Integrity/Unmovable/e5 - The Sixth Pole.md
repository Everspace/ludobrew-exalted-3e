The palace of creation becomes, for a moment, based upon her unwavering belief as much as the 5 elements themselves.

While the solar concentrates, the wyld ceases to be out to extreme range, and the taint of their twisting (such as harmful mutations) cease to be while the charm is active. Concentration takes up her turn as a miscellaneous action, which cannot be flurried.

Creatures of the Wyld, or things anathema to creation itself suffer (Essence + Intimacy) withering damage for the first turn and at the beginning of every turn the solar takes, which the solar gains up to (Intimacy)i. This turns to dice of Aggrivated damage in crash.

Instead of taking the damage, beings that are able to may instead form themselves into a subordinate of the Solar and fully part of creation. The creatures become merits Followers or powerful Retainers as appropriate. Their existence is now linked to the solar, and have a Defining and unalterable intimacy towards them, and consider betrayal or acts against her unacceptable orders.

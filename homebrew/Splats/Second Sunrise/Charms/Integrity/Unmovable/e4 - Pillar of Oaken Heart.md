The Unmovable makes their companions also Unmovable, as the wicked must move both her and hers.

After witnessing a social influence and before it succeeds, the solar may prevent it from succeeding by forcing it through herself first. The speaker must also convince her with the same argument.

If they fail to convince the Unmovable, the speaker is silenced for the rest of the scene as her words become nothing of any import. He speaks and gestures but is not heard, trusted, or taken seriously.

The solar imparts stranger and stranger esoterica that they know to the willing student.

This charm allows the solar to teach things such as Spells, Eclipse tagged charms, Thaumaturgies, and more mysterious merits that they themselves posses.

A mortal can be inducted into Terrestrial Circle Sorcery by the solar's grace, gaining the appropriate merit and a single spell that the solar knows. This process takes at least a season, and a significant investment of attention. An exalt may instead go into XP dept to acquire the appropriate charm if able, and taking the appropriate amount of time to quire it. Exalts may induct upto a circle that the teacher has aquired themselves.

Regardless of mortal or exalt, their shaping ritual is one of the following:

## Ephemerally Instructed

* **Memory of Sun**: Once a scene, when the sorcerer quotes the teacher or references their lessons in a stunt to their shape sorcery, they may add the higher of (Teacher's Essence or 3) sorcerous motes to the roll.
* **Lessons Well Learnt**: Once a day, the sorcerer may review her lessons, the next time they roll shape sorcery they gain the higher of (Intelligence or Lore) sorcerous motes.
* **Student Becomes Teacher**: The sorcerer may perform a hallow, but still useful imitation of a lession delivered by the solar. This takes roughly a day of their attention, and gains 1 sorcerous mote for each person taught up to (Lore) motes to be used on sorcery in the future.

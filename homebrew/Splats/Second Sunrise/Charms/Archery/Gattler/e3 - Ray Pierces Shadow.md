The gattler channels her outer light into a bow, or from her firewand to erupt in golden flame.

Reload your weapon instantly for every attack until your next turn, and remove up to (Archery/2, round up) worth of penalties due to obstruction, obscurity, or being unable to see your target.

If the Solar knows _Spirit Cutting Strike_, then that is applied for free with this charm (being unable to see your target is a -3 penalty that can be negated by this charm).

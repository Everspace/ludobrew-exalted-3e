Your kingdom borders stretch, and forcibly exist wherever your benevolence shines.

When the solar commits this charm, they select an organization or part of one they control. Within the borders of it, beings of the Wyld, and Creatures of Darkness may not warp or twist the nature of things that belong to that organization, and members always die a peaceful and blissful death and can never be desecrated by magic. This protection is broken if transgressor succeeds on a contested roll with a Relevant Pool vs the solar's (\[Charisma, Wits, or Intelligence] + Bureaucracy) to defy the solar's heavenly order in front of them. The first time this fails, the transgressor learns of the person they must seek to break this protection.

The Solar Lawyer does not let stray clauses or strange requirements slip by. Their understanding is complete for any legal document presented to them.

Perfectly understand a legal document (spoken or written) presented to you. A presenter is incapable of hiding additional information, embezzlement, or abuse of authority while presenting it. Magically tampered or prepared documents reveal themselves as such, and give the solar (Bureaucracy) dice and motes on future rolls to unearth the truth of the particular document. If an effect such as *Letter-Within-A-Letter Technique* was used, the Solar may contest the presenter's guile with [Perception or Wits] + Bureaucracy. If failed, the exalt knows that there is a hidden message in the document, but it has no legal meaning.

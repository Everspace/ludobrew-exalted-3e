This works identically to Summon the Loyal Steel (Ex3 347) with the following changes:

The Solar may banish any weapon for which they have 3 charms in the combat ability they use to calculate their attack pool to use it with. This includes any single Martial Art style for which they have 3 charms, in which they may banish any compatible weapon.

A solar may also banish shields with this charm.

The solar banishes various trinkets and baubles, beckoning the right tool for the job with a thought to their hand.

The solar may banish odds and ends that are not covered by Summon the Loyal Steel or Hauberk-Summoning Gesture, by using this charm. The Solar may summon any item banished reflexively, but requires a simple action (or activation of this charm) to banish such an item.

Items that are very large (like a Warstrider, or a large boulder) require a different charm. The intent is for items like Belt of Shadow Walking or a Winterbreath Jar to be available on your person in an inconspicuous way.

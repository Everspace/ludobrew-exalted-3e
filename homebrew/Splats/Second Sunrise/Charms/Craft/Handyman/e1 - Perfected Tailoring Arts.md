Perform a repair project, and perfectly adapt something for someone that it was ill suited for.

A solar may make a home in sunken Luthe tailor-made for an Ifriti and their life around it; a series of swords perfected for swinging in the air while winged.

This prevents any physical complications from applying to mundane items or features improved with this charm.

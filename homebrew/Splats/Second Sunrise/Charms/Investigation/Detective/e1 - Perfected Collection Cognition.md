The Detective can easily see explore the minds of order, and understand the person who exists in chaos.

When presented with a collection of things,

- They may instantly find an item in a collection, or assertain if it exists at all within it.
- They instantly know if something is missing or should be there unless contested with magic (giving them an automatic success to attempt to overcome it).
- Add the owner and/or primary curator to their **Suspect Library**, and may perform a case person action gaining an insight to an intimacy that person has to the collection or a principle they hold that resulted in it's current state.

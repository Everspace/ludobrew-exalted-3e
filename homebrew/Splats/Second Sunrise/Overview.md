## What is this crazy thing?

**Second Sunrise** is a redesign of the solar charmset, that focuses on

* moving dice tricks and "success boosters" to a separate tree called [Excellency](/second-sunrise/excellency) that is able to be purchased for any ability.
* giving each ability archetypal roles to follow and act in accordance with.
* each charm is a new and exciting tool to have.
* giving supernals the ability to get "one cool trick" from character generation.
* lowering essence requirements to allow dabbling in many things.

## Purchasing Excellencies?

The default solar excellency from your caste, favoured, or ability with at least 1 charm in it is still available. The Excellency tree contains

Effects like vanilla's Excellent Strike in Melee is now simply [Excellent Solar Ability](/second-sunrise/excellency/excellent-solar-ability), and replaces them as options for purchases.

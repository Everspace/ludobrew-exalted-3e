Designed to channel the strengths and ideals of the Tyrant Lizard

Keywords: `Tyrant Lizard` and `Athletics`

While attuned to The Tyrant's Band, the solar enjoys 3 charm dice on any Strength roll, and treat her strength as 3 higher for the purposes of feats of Stength.

- e1 Tyrant Body Exercise = ISE becomes perm (it's happening)
- e1 Sinew of Giants = 1m Use STR instead of Dex on a combat roll

- e1 Prey Strangling Attitude = 3m double 9's to land a grapple
- └ e1 Grip of Teeth Method = Roll an unmodifyable STR + Athletics vs incoming rounds to lose to maintain control.
- e1 Flawless Heave = 2m Reroll 1's on Athletics until they fail to appear
- └ e2 Poised Tyrant's Attitude = 2m Reflexively/Flurry FoS
- └─ e3 Mountain Tossing Joy = (Suspect) Successful FoS refunds the motes spent on it? Restores 1 WP?
- └── e3 Enemy Launching Atemi = 1wp 2i Heaven Thunder Hammer FoS/Attack/Gambit thing. STR/Ath successes - their defense, 3 knock prone, 5 close range (short fall), 7 medium range (medium fall), 13 extreme ranges (extreme fall)
- └─── e4 ?Name? = You are always meeting the strength prerequesites, and may play with the big boys without using a charm.
- └──── e5 Tyrant Lizard Arete = Attack of the 40ft whatever you are

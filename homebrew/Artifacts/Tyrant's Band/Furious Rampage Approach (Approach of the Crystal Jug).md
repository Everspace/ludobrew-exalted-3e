Nothing comes between the Tyrant Lizard and its prey.

The exalt adds 3 automatic successes to attacks or rushes targeting their prey marked with Hungry Eyes Style, and may add 3 automatic non-charm successes to follow them through cover with a Feat of Strength like walls or other things that may bar her way.

**Special Activation:** This Evocation awakens at no cost when the wielder removes an obstacle blocking her from her quarry during Hungry Eyes Style with a Feat of Strength.

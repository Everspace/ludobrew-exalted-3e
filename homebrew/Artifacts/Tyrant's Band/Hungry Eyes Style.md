Nothing can stop a hungry lizard from their next meal, and the wearer adopts a similar hungry look in their eye.

The bearer selects a being that she is aware of as a target of their hunger and for the rest of the scene she rerolls:

* 3 failures on all combat rolls to attack, pursue, or contest the escape of her prey
* 2 failures on all feats of strength, and threaten actions against the snacks and obstacles in the way.

Difficult terrain never impedes her from moving towards the offender, nor does anything less than full cover provide any benefit to them against her attacks.

**Special Activation:** This Evocation awakens at no cost when the wielder kills a powerful opponent.

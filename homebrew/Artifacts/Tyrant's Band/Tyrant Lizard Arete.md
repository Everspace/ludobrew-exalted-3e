The exalt stands taller and taller, until they become the Tyrant Lizard.

The bearer of Tyrant's Band grows to roughly 40ft and takes on a terrifying appearance.
She also gains the Legendary Size merit for the rest of the scene.

Against smaller enemies:

* You do not take onslaught penalties from any attack unless magical.
* **Withering** attacks cannot drop the wearer below 1i unless they have a post-soak damage of 10 dice (still gaining the full initiative worth of damage).
* **Decisive** attacks cannot deal more than (3 + attacker's strength) levels of damage with a single attack unless otherwise added by Charms or other magic.

If the wielder already has the Legendary Size merit for some other mysterious reason, they may instead pay 5m 1wp

In addition she gains 4 -0 health levels while this evocation is active, and may reflexively activate Hungry Eyes Style for free.

This Evocation can only be used once per story. The Exalt may reset it when she resets after performing a feat of strength difficulty 10 or higher to achieve or assist in a goal or solve a problem for her or her circle. The Dawn Caste anima power cannot reset this Evocation

**Special Activation:** attunement blah blah blah

**Note:** I don't have enough charms between the start and this one. Also it needs something spicer perhaps

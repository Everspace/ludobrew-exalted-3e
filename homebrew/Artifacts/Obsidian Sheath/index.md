This armour looks like a articulated plate made of glassy, yet flexible black stone. It is trimmed with gold hues made of oricalcum. When the user attunes to this item, it shrinks and becomes form-fitting; the armour acts as if it were a second skin allowing it to be concealed beneath ordinary clothing. On its front is a blazon of the Unconquered Sun, and wearing it is by virtue a prayer in his service.

It was originally worn by the Elite troops of the Dragon Kings, but it is rare within the Age of Sorrows. Most surviving examples of the Obsidian Sheath have ended up in the arsenals of various powers, and not used often even then due to the unfortunate iconography.

By attuning to the Obsidian Sheath, the wearer is blessed with considerable strength and agility as the plate assists in its user's movement. A lawbringer becomes able to move at a speed of 15 miles per hour outside of combat, covering up to 210 miles in a day without fatigue. It's slim fitting makes it easy to conceal under clothing, and it's perfect fit makes the wearer suffer no mobility penalties for it.

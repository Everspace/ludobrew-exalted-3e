name: Prior Blessings Meditation
artifact: Six Blessings
cost: Light of 6 beads
essence: 3
type: Reflexive

The movements of creation (and the things inside) fill everything with essence. Your prayers filled the beads, and now you empty them to begin anew.

Refill your mote by 5m for each bead (30m), and regain 3wp, rolling join battle once again.

You may use this charm if able as a scene ends if all 6 beads are lit up (rolling join battle if it amuses you).

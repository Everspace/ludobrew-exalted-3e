It is said when lessons are not learned fate repeats itself. The sidereal exalted haven't learned anything. Upon donning a familiar disguise, and carrying a familiar walking stick, a solar named Joseph travelled to Yu Shan. The Neophyte Sidereal (now a proper elder) accepted a second request of starmetal on peach-tree wood at the behest of a peer.

"A blessing of the maidens on each bead, how lovely!" said she as she did her work. "But you brought six beads for five maidens. What should be put on the last?"

Joseph replied "Trickery, for we could always use more mirth in our life" and she agreed.

Several hours later upon the final finishing stroke she had realized what had happened yet again.

Immediately the beads disappeared from her hands and a green turtle streaked across Yu Shan bathed in a golden glow.

The Six Blessings don't count as armour for the purposes of martial arts.

## The six blessings

Each bead lights up with it's blessing for the duration of a scene when you perform one of the actions associated with the blessing, lighting them in their maiden's colour (and a lovely peach colour for Gnomon's bead).

- Mercury's blessing is **Adventure**, it lights up when you use your first movement to venture into battle or succeed on a rush.
- Venus' blessing is **Joy**, it lights up when instill a positive intimacy to the wielder or a member of the circle in an opponent, or aid a battlegroup with a rally.
- Mars' blessing is **Victory**, it lights up when you initiative crash a non-trivial opponent, or recover from initiative crash.
- Saturn blessing is **Completeness**, it lights up when you defeat a non-trivial enemy or battlegroup.
- Jupiter blessing is **Knowledge**, it lights up when you successfully read intent, or introduce a fact.
- Gnomon's blessing is **Trickery**, it lights up when you successfully perform a gambit, or preform a larcenous or otherwise devious action to the bewilderment of another.

Upon attuning to Six Blessings, and the user is resonant with starmetal, one of the "Smiling" evocations is unlocked for free.

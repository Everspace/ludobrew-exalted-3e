Each bead is a prayer, and every prayer a blessing confirred. Jupiter and Gnomon share a kindred spirit towards lurking in shadows and getting up to no good.

When the bead of **Knowledge** or **Trickery** is lit, rolls for Occult, Lore, Larceny, Stealth, and initiative rolls on gambits are benefited by 1 non-charm autosuccess.

When 3 beads are lit, this increases to 2 non-charm autosuccesses.

When all 6 beads are lit, gambits will automatically succeed the initiative roll.

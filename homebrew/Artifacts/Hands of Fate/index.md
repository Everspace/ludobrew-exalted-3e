These gloves have been recorded throughout history as appearing before people in a time of need.

Extrodinarily and exceptionally ordinary, these fine gloves appear in all manner of mundane shapes to entice a person to put them on. From that point onwards they move unseen and guide their wearer's actions in mysterous and subtle ways.

Legend says they dropped from the constillation of the gauntlet, but it is a mystery to their origins.

By attuning to the Hands of Fate, the wearer is blessed with with a gentile guidance to their endeavors. This reduces the difficulty of Investigation rolls by 1 if a Lawbringer finds themselves in a situation that could be reconciled by their hands navigating for them, or a lucky coincidence. This could be something like finding the correct book in a vast library, or a hand accidentally brushing across the lever to turn off a First Age deathtrap.

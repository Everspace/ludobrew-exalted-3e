With a flourish, essence-infused chains whirl themselves out from the solar’s surroundings. Shackles that bind even countless enemies to the exalt’s will.

You may begin a **basic project** (page 31689) to create bindings in order to establish a grapple on a battle group with a difficulty equal to its
(Size \* (Might + 1) ).

In order to Restain, Drag, Throw, or Slam during this grapple, you must first perform a feat of strength equal to (Size \* 2) of the battlegroup.

Here are some examples of the difficulty to restrain different types of battlegroups:

- A small group of thugs (Size: 2, Might: 0): <br/>
  Difficulty: 2 (2 \* (0 + 1))
- A couple of Fey warriors (Size: 2, Might 1): <br/>
  Difficulty: 4 (2 \* (1 + 1))
- A company of bronze statues (Size 3, Might: 2): <br/>
  Difficulty: 9 (3 \* (2 + 1))

**Resonant:** Unlock this evocation for free when use Distance Shifting Arete to restrain a powerful opponent, or make a grand display of strength that would have been otherwise impossible without it.

The ground beneath stretches out the exalt in a pattern that mirrors Handwerksring’s engravings. These lines guide and spread the brilliance of creation from the exalt’s soul upon the soil around them. Their Anima banner flares as they reside within, forming a lighthouse to guide people to safety from those who wish creation harm.

The exalt becomes the centre of a Solar Demense(●●) of (Essence \* 5) yards in radius for as long as they remains within the bounds of the circle, with anima banners at bonfire for it’s duration. Within the demesne, no sorcerous effects of the Wyld may exist within its bounds, and beings of the wyld may not enter. Fey within the circle upon its inception are ejected out as it forms.

Mortals otherwise possessed by the Wyld are left in a catatonic state until leaving, and those with mutations from the wyld are afflicted with either rapturous pain behaving like a -4 wound penalty, or they are forced into remission and are effectless.

Particularly powerful Fey may attempt to persuade or taunt the exalt into leaving. The circle also does not prevent those that wish the Lawgiver harm from entering.

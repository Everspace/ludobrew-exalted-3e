In a twirl and twist the Exalt works the ground around him much like she works the edges of a blade. The earth around the solar becomes sharp and hostile to those not prepared to travel.

Treat close range around the solar as an environmental hazard inflicting two dice of lethal damage, with difficulty 4 to resist with a (Dexterity + Athletics roll). If the character is barefoot it is treated as difficult terrain as well.

Any character wearing armoured boots, can generally ignore the debris, and the solar may always move unhindered through the terrain. The exalt may also guide an ally through with a continued touch.

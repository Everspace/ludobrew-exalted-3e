Attuned to its own creations, Handwerksring acts as a bridge between the weapon and it’s creator.

You may instead use an appropriate Craft skill when wielding a weapon of your own making instead of Archery, Brawl, Martial Arts, Melee, or Thrown. This roll is only compatible with the charms and evocations of the original roll.

For example, while brandishing a spear, you may roll (Dexterity + Craft[Weaponsmithing]) for a withering attack.

You are also always considered resonant with the weapon’s materials while wielding it.

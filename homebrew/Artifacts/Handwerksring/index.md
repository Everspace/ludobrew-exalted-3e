Created during Still Star's exaltation, this simple iron band was inlaid with white jade secretly gathered from many quarries, and small shavings from his masterâ€™s projects and commissions. His inexperience with artifice however led to a complication, and a shard of the his exalted soul had slipped within.

After discovering that his teacher had been hiding money, and selling weapons to unscrupulous buyers, Still Star escaped to Chiaroscuro after an altercation. When asked for his name he adopted the monkier "Lauded Iron" to avoid suspicions, and seem like a God-blooded rather than the Anathema he was.

Etched into the interior of the ring is Still Star's maker's mark, which he presses into each of upon completion of each of his workings, as a signature.

Additionally, you are able to reflexively use <book r="Craftsman Need No Tools"></book> with no cost on inorganic materials like iron and stone, and may pay 3m to override this restriction for anything else. You also develop a minor intimacy of "I give it my all", at the beginning of each story.

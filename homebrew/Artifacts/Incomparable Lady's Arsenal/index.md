This is an exquisite box made of stark white jade and deep ebony. Inlaid are patterns of blue flowers. On it are a multitude of knobs and doors, which open smoothly and without sound at a single touch, extending generously past where they should. At the front is a pair of cabinet doors, that open to reveal a compartment that holds sparkling cutlery that never goes missing and the accompaniments enough to serve up to 6 people.

Several drawers contain crystalline vials filled with resplendent inks, and little tins filled with various teas and spices. A larger drawer holds a spare ensemble in a motif in the style of the chest.

The box functions as a combination <book r="Stoneheart Coffer"></book> and <book r="Winterbreath Jar"></book>. Things placed inside are kept fresh and still. Its exceptional quality and bounty removes almost any social penalty. People not accustomed to the elegance of high society suffer a -2 to their guile while being served.

Attuning to the box for 1m reveals to the bearer's eye a multitude of additional drawers that only her essence can open. This also allows her to subsume it into her anima until it is needed to be used, reappearing in a manner reminiscent to her anima banner.

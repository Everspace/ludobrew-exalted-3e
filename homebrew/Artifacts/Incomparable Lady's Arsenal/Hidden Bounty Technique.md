The bearer of the Incomparable Lady's Arsenal sometimes finds themselves in the middle of nowhere and far from the reaches of civilization. However, there is no fear, since she had not exhausted her supplies just yet.

Whirling through almost every drawer they know, the user pulls enough leftover cakes, sandwiches, and other small morsels to constitute a meal for everyone in their travelling group.

This Evocation may only be used once per story. The Exalt may reset it when she serves a successful tea with the Incomparable Lady's Arsenal that results in a successful bargain, inspire, threaten, or instill.

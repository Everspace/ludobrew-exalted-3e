This collection of dreamstones records what the attuned witnesses, then stores up to 5 days of that information within them while they are attuned to for 1m, and mortal may attune to them for 3wp.

The wielder may benefit from 2 dice to recollect things that have been witnessed in this manner.

With concentration, the user quickly relives these experiences as if they were experiencing the moments themselves. The user may cut out vast swaths of information, removing what is unimportant or unnecessary but never falsifying what was captured. Careful editing every evening will allow for a full month's worth of delightful, or grisly experiences to be imparted into the Memory Beads.
